							<p class="color-text-a">Ministry of Ayush has initiated
								efforts for centralised collection of morbidity statistics
								pertaining to various systems of medicine under the Ministry
								viz. Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy.
								In this regard, the Ministry in association with Ayurveda,
								Siddha and Unani (A-S-U) research councils have developed
								Morbidity Codes and Standard Terminologies of Ayurveda, Unani
								and Siddha systems of medicine. For Homeopathy and Yoga &
								Naturopathy systems the International Classification of Diseases
								(ICD- 10/11 Codes) of World Health Organisation has been adopted
								for this purpose.</p>
							<p class="color-text-a">In this regard, the Ministry of Ayush
								has developed a portal named National Ayush Morbidity and
								Standardized Terminologies Portal (NAMSTP). The portal was
								launched by Shri Narendra Modi, the Honâ€™ble Prime Minister of
								India on the occasion of 2nd Ayurveda Day (17th October 2017) at
								All India Institute of Ayurveda, New Delhi. The portal provides
								Standardized Terminologies & Morbidity Codes for Ayurveda,
								Siddha and Unani systems of medicine along with W.H.O ICD-10/11
								codes meant for dual coding and morbidity reporting for Yoga,
								Naturopathy and Homoeopathy Systems. These are meant for
								unambiguous reporting, electronic data submission through
								individual institutions and gradually moving towards adopting
								Electronic Health Records (E.H.R.).</p>
							<p class="color-text-a">In this connection, please note that
								the usage of Morbidity codes and the portal has the potential to
								revolutionize morbidity statistics data collection and health
								care delivery reporting pertaining to Ayush systems and bring to
								light the contribution of Ayush systems to the health care
								delivery system of our country on real time basis and the
								benefits of sustaining such activity is expected to have
								positive bearing on future policy making.</p>
