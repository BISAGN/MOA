						</div>
						<p class="color-text-a">Sowa-Rigpa is a system of medicine
							that is one of the oldest medical traditions across the world.
							The term Sowa-Rigpa means Knowledge of Healing and derives its
							meaning from the Bhoti Language. This system was reinforced in
							the Trans-Himalayan region and is popular in the Himalayan
							societies such as Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh (Spiti and Lahoul),
							Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal (Darjeeling), Arunachal Pradesh,
							and Sikkim.</p>

						<p class="color-text-a">Sowa-Rigpa has been recognized and
							promoted by the Government of India as a traditional medical
							system. Just like the spread of Buddhism, the Sowa- Rigpa has
							also established its influence in various parts of the world.
							Also known as the Amchi System of medicine, it is practiced in
							some parts of China, the Himalayan regions of India, Mongolia,
							Nepal, Russia, and Bhutan. Sowa- Rigpa is perceived to be similar
							to Ayurvedic Philosophy. More than 75 percent of the Sowa-Rigpa
							tests have been derived from the Ashtanga Hridaya; a famous
							exposition of Ayurveda. Many medicines of the Indian-origin such
							as Ashwagandha, Guggulu, Triphala, Ashok, Haridra, etc. are used
							in the Sowa-Rigpa system for treatment purposes.</p>

						<p class="color-text-a">India had been a learning hotspot for
							Buddhist art and culture and attracted a lot of Tibetan Students.
							Also, many Indian scholars were invited to prorogate Buddhism and
							other art and sciences of India. This association resulted in the
							translation and preservation of Indian Literature on art,
							culture, language, science, and religion in the Tibetan language.
							These texts were further enhanced in Tibet and are now preserved
							in Tibetan Literatures, both in Canonical and Non-Canonical
							forms. Sowa-Rigpa or the Science of Healing is an example of the
							same. Gyud-Zi or four tantra was the fundamental textbook of this
							form of medicine that was translated from India and was then
							enriched in the region of Tibet. The principles of Sowa-Rigpa,
							its do’s and don’ts, pulse examination, and dietary guidelines
							are some factors that indicate its proximity within India.</p>
