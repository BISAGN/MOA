						</div>
						<p class="color-text-a">Ayush is the acronym of the medical
							systems that are being practiced in India such as Ayurveda, Yoga
							& Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. These systems are
							based on definite medical philosophies and represent a way of
							healthy living with established concepts on prevention of
							diseases and promotion of health. The basic approach of all these
							systems on health, disease and treatment are holistic. Because of
							this, there is a resurgence of interest on Ayush systems. Yoga
							has now become the icon of global health and many countries have
							started integrating it in their health care delivery system.
							Similarly there is great curiosity to understand the principles
							and practice of Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Siddha and Unani especially
							due to growing challenges in medicine in Non Communicable
							Diseases (NCDs), Life style disorders, long term diseases, multi
							drug resistant diseases, emergence of new diseases etc. In 1995,
							with the objective of optimal and focused development of these
							systems, the Department of Indian Medicine and Homeopathy (ISM &
							H) was created in the Union Ministry of Health and Family
							Welfare. In 2003, this Department was re named as Department of
							Ayush.</p>
						<p class="color-text-a">India has a rich heritage of medical
							wisdom derived from the Vedas that prevailed as Ayurveda. This
							was further enriched by the ancient Saints (Rishi's) with Siddha
							system and Yoga practices. These were the principal medical
							practices of the country for centuries, forming part of Indian
							ethos and culture. Unani Tibb that was known from period of
							Hippocrates came to India during 8th Century A D. subsequently,
							the Western medicine that is based on biomedical concepts,
							commonly known as Allopathy, came to India and also got
							assimilated into the Indian medical practice. Homeopathy, a
							system developed in Germany in 18th century quickly gained
							popularity and has got blended with the Indian traditional
							medical practices due to similarity in its holistic medical
							philosophy and principles. Naturopathy, a drug less system of
							healthy living practices of all civilizations got organized and
							also become part of the medical pluralism of the country. Thus,
							there evolved a unique medical paradigm with traditional
							practices along with the Bio medicine. After Independence, the
							Government started supporting all the medical systems for their
							growth, thereby offering the public a choice for their routine
							health care need. Because of this as now there are public
							patronage and institutional support to widen the strength of
							these systems in curative, preventive, promotive aspects of
							health care.</p>
						<p class="color-text-a">The bio medicine based on experimental
							concepts has brought innovation with consistent research and
							updating knowledge. Due to that there are remarkable information
							on causation of diseases, their course, prognosis, diagnostics,
							management of diseases etc. Most of the infectious diseases that
							were the major cause of high mortality are now conquered.
							Management of high risk cases, surgical interventions, etc has
							brought in marvels in health sector. However, there is an
							increase in the incidence of Non Communicable Diseases. Ayush
							medicines that come under the category of experienced medicine
							are cost effective, known for safety issues and time tested.
							Ayush medicines are widely used as a standalone option or as
							adjunct with Bio medicine in the long term diseases. Therefore,
							the relevance of Ayush has become more now because of this change
							in health paradigm. Keeping this fact in view the Government is
							encouraging a pluralistic approach in health care where every
							medical system is allowed to grow on the basis of its evident
							strength.</p>
