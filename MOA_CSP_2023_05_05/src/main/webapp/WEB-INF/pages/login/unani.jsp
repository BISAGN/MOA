						</div>
						<p class="color-text-a">Unani or the science of health and
							healing is a system of medicine that has blended with Indiaâ€™s
							tradition and has made it one of the leading countries practicing
							this form of medicine. The Unani System of medicine originated in
							Greece around 2500 years ago, and its foundation was laid by the
							Hippocrates. A tradition of Graeco-Arabic medicine, Unani
							medicine has a herbo-animo-mineral foundation. In addition to
							being an original science of medicine, the Unani is also a rich
							storehouse of philosophies and principles of medicine that holds
							value to the field of medicine and science in general.</p>
						<p class="color-text-a">The Arabs are the ones who rendered
							the Greek Literature of the medicine into their own enhanced
							system of medicine through their contributions. For the same,
							they incorporated the concepts of Pathology, Therapeutics,
							Physics, Chemistry, Anatomy, Physiology, Botany, and Surgery. The
							Unani system of medicine was enriched by Middle East countries
							and Asian countries owing to the contemporary form of the
							traditional system. It was the Arabs who introduced the Unani
							system to India which acquired strong roots within no time. The
							Delhi Sultans provided patronage Unani Scholars hired some of
							them as court physicians and state employees.</p>
						<p class="color-text-a">However, the system suffered a major
							setback during the British Rule, with the introduction of the
							Allopathic system. This further resulted in the downfall of the
							Unani System of medicine, with respect to its education,
							practice, and research. For about two centuries, the
							effectiveness of this system faced neglect, just like other
							traditional forms of medicine. It was the efforts of the Nizam of
							Hyderabad, the Azizi family in Lucknow, and the Sharifi family in
							Delhi; that Unani medicine survived the British period. The
							system saw its revival during the freedom struggle with Hakim
							Ajmal Khan, who established an Ayurvedic and Unani Tibbia College
							and Hindustani Dawakhana in the year 1916. It was inaugurated by
							Mahatma Gandhi on February 13, 1921, and the Unani system was
							then patronized by various Princely states. After independence,
							the Unani system witnessed a boost, along with other forms of
							traditional medicine. The Government of India took various
							measures towards the all-round development of this system and
							established various research institutions, educational
							institutions, testing laboratories, and hospitals, and hired
							recognized practitioners. At present, India is one of the leading
							nations that practice the Unani system of medicines and has the
							largest number of institutions that focus on Unani education,
							research, and healthcare. The Unani system of medicine provides
							treatment of diseases of the entire human body. Unani has proved
							to be highly effective for treating chronic ailments and diseases
							of the liver, skin, reproductive systems, musculoskeletal and
							immunological disorders.</p>
