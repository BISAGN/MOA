						</div>
						<p class="color-text-a">Homoeopathy is a combination of two
							Greek words: Homois and Pathos. Homois means similar and pathos
							means suffering. In other words, homoeopathy is a system of
							treating diseases with remedies. Also known as Homoeopathic
							medicine, this system is based on two alternative theories:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="color-text-a"><b>“Like cures like” –</b> It is
								the natural law of healing that says that a substance causing
								symptoms of a disease in a healthy individual would cure similar
								symptoms in a sick individual. This doctrine is also known as
								similia similibus curentur, and was given by Samuel Hahnemann in
								the year 1796.</li>
							<li class="color-text-a"><b>“Law of minimum dose” –</b>
								Homoeopathic products are mostly diluted to an extent that it
								eliminates the presence of the molecules of the original
								substance. It is believed that a lower dose of medication
								results in more effectiveness.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="color-text-a">Homoeopathic products are made from
							plants such as mountain herbs, minerals like white arsenic,
							poison ivy, and animals like crushed bees. These homoeopathic
							products take the form of sugar pellets, ointments, tablets,
							gels, creams, and drops. The treatments are tailored as per the
							needs of each individual. This means that people with different
							ailments who have the same conditions can receive different
							treatments.</p>
						<p class="color-text-a">Homoeopathy is a form of treatment
							that dates back to two centuries and continues to serve humanity
							to date. It is practiced almost everywhere across the globe and
							has gained a lot of popularity in India as well. The gentleness
							of its cure is what makes more than 100 million people of the
							Indian population depend on this treatment. And, India has around
							a quarter of a million registered homoeopathic doctors who are
							more than other countries across the world. Homoeopathy has been
							into practice for the past century in India and has blended quite
							well with the Indian tradition. It follows a holistic approach
							towards achieving the inner balance of an individual on mental,
							physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. Homoeopathy is a
							time-tested therapy and continues to spread its effectiveness
							around the world.</p>
